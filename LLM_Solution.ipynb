First, the `agent` parameter, which specifies the type of *agent*, such as `head_department`, `data_scientist`, or `ml_engineer`. Second, the `prompt` parameter, which is the prompt you are giving to the agent. You can also utilize the `generate_prompt()` function to employ an *AI Assistant* to generate potential prompts. Third, the `time_wait` parameter, which determines how frequently the system checks the run status, measured *in seconds*. Finally, the `only_code` parameter, which defaults to *False*, determines whether the output message should contain only code or include other messages as well."

This variance is primarily due to the LLM's inconsistency: it sometimes generates solutions that are close to accurate, while at other times, they are significantly off-mark. To improve this, we need to set the most effective instructional guides possible, aiming to steer our agents towards the desired objectives. There is ongoing research in this area, focusing on enhancing the overall performance of multi-agent systems through a variety of machine learning and AI-related techniques, and I think that's the future.\n",

        "For certain fixed user prompts, manually written code, known for its precision, may be the best choice. However, for the LLM solution, we aim for a general approach since user prompts are often not unique and not fixed. Despite having similar solutions or meanings, these prompts require a flexible response, which LLMs are well-equipped to provide. This makes LLMs an efficient solution for addressing a wide range of issues.\n",

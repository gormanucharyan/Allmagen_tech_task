						"mm_dma" - DMA (Designated Market Area);
						"osName" - OS;
						"model" - device model name;
						"hardware" -  type of device;
						"site_id" - website, where was the viewing.
						
						"tag" - type of event:
									the letter <v> at the beginning of some events means that the event occurred without a click 									 is view-through. Otherwise, we have a click-through event;
									
									The fclick event is the first click (used to calculate CTR). 
									
									NOTE: This means the tag starting with letter 'v' is labeled as 									unclicked, the one with not starting with letter'v' means clicked.
			
Click Through Rate (CTR)
CTR (click rate) = 100 * click_count / impression_count %.
In our case, click_count is the number of fclick events.


Event Permille (EvPM)
EvPM (event rate) = 1000 * event_count / impression_count
for the requested event type. The view/click-through attribute does not need to be taken into account (i.e., when calculating EvPM for (v)registration, we have the sum of registration and vregistration in the numerator).

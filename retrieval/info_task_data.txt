						"mm_dma" - DMA (Designated Market Area);
						"osName" - OS;
						"model" - device model name;
						"hardware" -  type of device;
						"site_id" - website, where was the viewing.
						
						"tag" - type of event:
									the letter <v> at the beginning of some events means that the event occurred without a click 									 is view-through. Otherwise, we have a click-through event;
									
									The fclick event is the first click (used to calculate CTR). 
									
									NOTE: This means the tag starting with letter 'v' is labeled as 									unclicked, the one with not starting with letter'v' means clicked.
									
The fclick event is the first click (used to calculate CTR). NOTE: This means the tag starting with letter 'v' should labeled as unclicked, the one with not starting with letter'v' means clicked (if needed to buil ML Model) 

This is the metrics for which you would have tasks like top 5 'hardware' by CTR or EvPM for signup event.		

	
Click Through Rate (CTR)
CTR (click rate) = 100 * click_count / impression_count %.
In our case, click_count is the number of fclick events.


Event Permille (EvPM)
EvPM (event rate) = 1000 * event_count / impression_count
for the requested event type. The view/click-through attribute does not need to be taken into account (i.e., when calculating EvPM for (v)registration, we have the sum of registration and vregistration in the numerator). for the requested event type. For instance EvPM for signup computes in this way 1000 * (counts of signup and vsignup) / (all event counts,in other words sum of tags value counts).
